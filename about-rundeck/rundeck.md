# Rundeck 

* We have jobs that run on a schedule to do certain things...Non-kubernetes analog would be a cron job.  We don't set up cron jobs.
* Rundeck does our deployments as well. There is an audit trail, centralized logging. We don't have to try to figure out what server a particular command was on.
* One-off Jobs

Nginx is its own seperate app.
