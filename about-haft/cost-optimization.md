# About Cloud Cost Optimization

### Public Clouds vs. API's

* Public clouds, also known as Infrastructure or Platform as a Service Providers, IaaS/PaaS providers, offer a huge array of tools and services and represent the largest and most fundamental players in the marketplace. Cost is typically billed per usage, but it can also be on a subscription basis, depending upon the service.
* API's are more in line with Software as a Service (SaaS) and may be built on top of the former, often have subscription fees, but can also be per-usage.
### Major Cloud Service Providers

* There are three major cloud service providers which dominate the majority of the marketplace, with AWS representing about 1/3rd of the marketplace, followed by Azure and Google Cloud (and Alicloud thereafter).
* All three cloud service providers offer cost management visibility tools.
