# Memory vs. DOM Storage

Selecting, accessing, and iterating DOM elements and reading and modifying their properties is one of the single slowest things you can do in browser JS. On the other hand, working with native JS objects is very fast. As a rule, I avoid working with the DOM as much as possible.
