https://redis.io/

> Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

* Redis is similar to an ORM from the standpoint of structuring data, however it seems to specialize particular types of data structures.
* Whereas something like SQLALchemy is very SQL-based, basically a relational database, Redis is a NoSQL database, and appears to be heavily geared toward key-value storing.
