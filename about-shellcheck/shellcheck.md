## About Shellcheck

https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck

> The goals of ShellCheck are

* To point out and clarify typical beginner's syntax issues that cause a shell to give cryptic error messages.

* To point out and clarify typical intermediate level semantic problems that cause a shell to behave strangely and counter-intuitively.

* To point out subtle caveats, corner cases and pitfalls that may cause an advanced user's otherwise working script to fail under future circumstances.

### Within Builds and Test Suites

From the shellcheck documentation:

> While ShellCheck is mostly intended for interactive use, it can easily be added to builds or test suites. It makes canonical use of exit codes, so you can just add a shellcheck command as part of the process.
