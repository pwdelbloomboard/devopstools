# About Feast

### Feast - Kubeflow Perspective

* [Feast Feature Store Documentation - Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/feature-store/overview/)

> Feature Stores address key challenges:

* Feature sharing and re-use. Building engineering features can be very time consuming in an end-to-end ML system, yet teams develop features in silos.
* Serving features at scale - 
* Consistency between training and serving
* Point-in-time correctness
* Data quality and validation
