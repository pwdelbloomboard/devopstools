# Project Management

Sprints vs Kanban

* Kanban - continous improvement
* Sprint - coordinated software delivery

Approaches to project management have a lot to do with where an organization is at and how long of a timeframe a various projects are.

Whereas in a more agency, or short-project type organization, continous improvement probably works a bit better because timelines might work contract by contract, and there are deep tradeoffs between quality and time, in longer-timeline organizations, there is a greater criticality in knowing timelines more precisely, which is a challenge.

The answer cannot always be to add engineers, or rather it can't automatically be to add additional engineers, but rather it's a business question, and the business may not always have the budget for jumping from one step to another.

Why use hours instead of storyparts?

* In a classic scrum model, you use storypoints to count the value of a ticket, not the amount of work complished. Rather than marking tickets as hours done, you mark value. Using hours to mark value are a way to justify whether to build more resources into a larger enterprise or organization, whereas value is more of an ongoing way of checking quality and customer quality.

Why are sprints a certain length long - 1 week or 2 weeks or whatever?

* Sprint lengths have a lot to do with budgeting - you need to pick some kind of length. A basic truism is that it's better often to pick consistent lengths and work consistently on a system, rather than not do a system.

Metrics don't accurately reflect our work, why using these metrics or what are we trying to achieve?

* Focusing on a particular metric has to do with the business goals - perhaps showing whether certain types of engineering efforts are either on time, or meeting customer expectations.
